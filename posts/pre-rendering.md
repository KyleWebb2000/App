Key features of Next.js

**Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Next.js allows you to perform server-side rendering, which means that the initial HTML content is generated on the server and sent to the client, improving performance and search engine optimization (SEO).

**Static Site Generation (SSG):** It supports static site generation, where pages are pre-rendered at build time, resulting in fast-loading, static HTML pages that can be deployed to a content delivery network (CDN).

**API Routes:** Next.js provides an easy way to create serverless API routes alongside your application. This allows you to handle server-side logic and data processing without setting up a separate server.

**File System Routing:** Next.js follows a file-based routing system, where the file structure in the pages directory automatically defines the application's routes. For example, a file named about.js inside the pages directory would create the /about route.
